# POLEGON
POLEGON stands for **P**rior-**O**blivious **L**ength **E**stimation in **G**enealogies with **O**riented **N**etwork. POLEGON works with inferred Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG) to re-calibrate the branch length, **without the usage of any prior**. The inferred ARGs should be in tskit format, with mutations mapped to branches. It is also important that the genealogies in the ARG should be **linked**, in that the adjacent trees should differ relatively small. After the branch length has been inferred, downstream analyses like inference of population size history can be subsequently done using the calibrated branch length.

The details of the algorithms can be found at: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2504461122, which is also the citation source.

# Input and output
POLEGON takes .trees files with tskit tree sequence format (of course there need to be mutations in it!). By default it writes all posterior samples to `<output>_node_samples.txt` and the posterior mean tree sequence to `<output>.trees`.

# Basic usage
Fixated on the topology, POLEGON can generate you the posterior samples of the ARG and the posterior average of them.

The basic commands is:

```
polegon_master -m mutation_rate -input input.trees -output output_prefix -n_samples N -thin K -scaling_rep L
```

The following details to these arguments can be displayed if you simply type `polegon_master`

|flag|required?|details|
|-------------------|-----|---|
|**-input**|required|input tree sequence file. (e.g. `path/to/input.trees`)|
|**-output**|required|output file prefix.|
|**-m**|conditionally required|per base pair per generation mutation rate.|
|**-g**|conditionally required|generation time in years. Required when `-tip_ages` is provided.|
|**-m_map**|conditionally required|mutation rate map for the region.|
|**-burn_in**|optional|the number of MCMC burn-in iterations discarded. Default: 2500|
|**-n_samples**|optional|the number of posterior ARG samples. Default: 1000|
|**-thin**|optional|the number of thinning iterations in MCMC. Default: 10|
|**-scaling_rep**|optional|the number of ARG rescaling steps after MCMC. Default: 5|
|**-scaling_bin**|optional|the number of time bins used for ARG rescaling. Default: 100|
|**-scaling_subsample**|optional|the number of posterior samples used to estimate the shared ARG rescaling grid and factors. Default: 10|
|**-tip_ages**|conditionally required|file of sample ages, in either of two auto-detected formats: one column (one age per diploid sample, in VCF sample order) or two columns (`name  calendar_age_BP`, where `name` is a diploid sample name). Required for heterochronous (ancient DNA) data. Tip ages supplied via this flag are prioritized, even when the input ARG already contains tip age information.|
|**-seed**|optional|random seed for the MCMC. Default: 42|
|**-cores**|optional|number of CPU cores for parallel chromatic Gibbs MCMC. Default: 1|
|**-no_mean**|optional|skip computing the posterior mean node ages.|
|**-memory_safe**|optional|flush unrescaled samples to disk during MCMC, then stream them back to apply the rescaling. Uses O(scaling_subsample × nodes) peak memory instead of the default O(samples × nodes), at the cost of reading the sample file twice.|

If you want to use a mutation map, rather than a constant mutation rate along the genome, the mutation map file should be formatted as follows:

```
0 100000 1.2e-8
100000 200000 2e-8
200000 300000 1e-8
```

this means that the mutation rate between 0–100 kb is 1.2×10⁻⁸, and between 100–200 kb is 2×10⁻⁸. Each row specifies a genomic interval [start, end) and its per-bp per-generation mutation rate. The intervals must cover the full sequence without gaps, and the last end coordinate must be greater than or equal to the sequence length in the tree sequence file.

# Heterochronous samples (ancient DNA)
For data sets containing samples from different time points (e.g., ancient DNA), provide the sampling ages and generation time:

```
polegon_master -m mutation_rate -input input.trees -output output_prefix -tip_ages ages.txt -g 29
```

The tip ages file can be given in two formats, with the column count detected automatically. Ages are in calendar years before present, one per diploid sample (the age is applied to both of the sample's haplotypes).

With **two columns** (`name  calendar_age_BP`), each age is matched by `name` to a labeled diploid sample (e.g. `tsk_0`); this requires the tree sequence to carry sample labels. Example:

```
tsk_0    0
tsk_1    3500
tsk_2    8000
```

With **one column**, give ages positionally in VCF sample order, one row per diploid sample. Use this when the tree sequence has no sample labels, such as raw SINGER output where the haplotypes are enumerated `0…n-1`. The same three diploid samples:

```
0
3500
8000
```

You can skip supplying the tip ages file if the input ARG tips already have the correct ages assigned.

# Suggestions from the developers
- By default, all MCMC samples are held in memory before rescaling: O(samples × nodes). Use `-memory_safe` flag to flush samples to disk and stream them during rescaling, reducing peak memory to O(scaling_subsample × nodes) at the cost of reading the sample file twice.
